- ask clarifying questions and make absolutely sure you understand the question before implementation
- talk through to yourself exactly how you would do it on paper if a math problem. Try to make sure the plan you have in code makes sense. For example  with colorful rope problem, I only added the min time of one of many balloons, BUT i was supposed to add the min time of all EXCEPT the most time consuming one... This is obvious once I think about it more, but if I really thought about it on paper, I should had caught this...
	- basically with previous 2 notes, make sure you are fully prepared before you start coding.
