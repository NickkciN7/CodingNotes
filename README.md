# notes
- set up nest.js backend and vite front end with eslint/prettier in a lerna powered monorepo
  - start here for order of files to read to get them set up: https://github.com/NickkciN7/notes/blob/main/Coding/Dev%20Setup/Overview.md
- and some other notes about relevant technology
- Algorithms class notes are in Coding/Algorithms
- The pasted images format in the markdown files for referencing them is used in the software obsidian like `![[Pasted image 20241123172459.png]]`. But so you don't have to download obsidian (unless you want to its decent note taking software and I left the obsidian format image emedding in these files too) I manually added github recognized markdown image links like `![Description](https://github.com/NickkciN7/CodingNotes/blob/main/Pasted%20image%2020241123172459.png)` for example ![Description](https://github.com/NickkciN7/CodingNotes/blob/main/Pasted%20image%2020241123172459.png). Got the github link by simply clicking the image file in the repo
