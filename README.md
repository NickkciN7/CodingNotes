# notes
- set up nest.js backend and vite front end with eslint/prettier in a lerna powered monorepo
  - start here for order of files to read to get them set up: https://github.com/NickkciN7/notes/blob/main/Coding/Dev%20Setup/Overview.md
- and some other notes about relevant technology
- Algorithms class notes are in Coding/Algorithms
- The pasted images and the format in the markdown files for referencing them is used in the software obsidian, so to see the pictures you have to download obsidian or for example change the format in the files manually from `![[Pasted image 20241123172459.png]]` to `![Description](https://github.com/NickkciN7/CodingNotes/blob/main/Pasted%20image%2020241123172459.png)` like ![Description](https://github.com/NickkciN7/CodingNotes/blob/main/Pasted%20image%2020241123172459.png) which is normal .md format for embedded pictures if you don't want to download obsidian. Get the github link by simply clicking the image file in the repo
